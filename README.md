Goal:
Our goal is to make a DAO that allows users to set fitness goals and achieve them while earning coins/rewards. This would allow for an entire community to make working out and exercising more fun. It would also allow a decentralized way to keep track of your fitness and workouts so you save your progress forever.

Use Cases:
User: the user would access our DAO through a link, create an account to login to their personal dashboard and then be able to set their goals and progress using Ethereum smart contracts. Whenever a user is done with a workout, they’d login and record their progress. After a certain number of workouts, they’d be rewarded with a utility coin that they could use to purchase NFTs on the site or premium workout routines from our site.

Other Necessary Features:

Blockchain:
Ethereum - to upload goals/progress for each user, storing that data and executing the smart contracts to reward users for progress

Frontend:
HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React.js, etc. for the website

Backend:
Node.js to handle server-side responsibilities such as interacting with the blockchain/database to retrieve necessary data

Database:
MongoDB to handle user authentication
